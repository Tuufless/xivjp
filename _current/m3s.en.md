## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Damage Down]</b> How strong is the damage down debuff in this 
fight?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The Damage Down debuff in this encounter lowers a player's damage by 
      <b>38%</b> for 30 seconds.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Barbarous Barrage]</b> I keep getting the angle slightly off, and get
  knocked out the arena with the last tower!
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>It's tempting to stand near the center of the tower to maximise your
      distance to the edge, but doing so makes your knockback angle much more
      sensitive to your positioning (increasing the chance you get knocked
      enough sideways out of the arena).</p>
      <p>Stand towards the outer end of the tower instead. This makes your
      knockback direction less sensitive to your positioning, and the knockback
      distance isn't enough to throw you out of the arena.</p>
