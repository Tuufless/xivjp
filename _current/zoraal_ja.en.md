### Things to note in Party Finder

- The three-hit *Bitter Whirlwind* tankbuster at the end of *Projection of 
  Turmoil* is taken by a tank invuln. However, there are two instances in the 
  fight, and *only* WAR can invuln both.

## Markers

Markers aren't really needed for this fight- maybe one marker at North just to
demarcate where North is (as that's where the line-of-stacks begins).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Projection of Turmoil]</b> Does debuffing the boss affect the damage from
  the stacks?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Yes, the damage source is still Zoraal Ja, so debuffs like <em>Addle,
      Dismantle, Feint, and Reprisal</em> will lower the stack damage.</p>
    </td>

<summary>
  <b>[Projection of Turmoil]</b> What was the "cheese strat", and what happened to it?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>On release, the debuffs that players got during <em>Projection of 
      Turmoil</em> would simply disappear if the timer expired without being
      triggered.</p>
      <p>This might seem okay because the "line-of-stacks" sweeps over the 
      arena, however, because the "death wall" in this instance is just a DoT,
      players discovered you could just step out <em>into</em> the death wall,
      avoiding the "line-of-stacks" altogether, and the debuffs would disappear
      without triggering anything.</p>
      <p>This was identified as an issue, and <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/6495aeb93d82245a8d7fe5aaee9e0d9f1121db0b">
      hotfixed about a week</a> after early access.</p>
      <p>Now, the stack triggers when the debuff's timer expires, invalidating 
      this method.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Jumps]</b> I keep getting flung off the platform! What determines the direction of travel?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are two sets of jumps in the encounter:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The paired jumps (with the white circles).
          <ul>
            <li>If the circles are centered on you, you just get thrown up and 
            down.</li>
            <li>If they are <em>not</em> centered on you, then you get thrown 
            from where <em>your partner</em> (whom the circle is centered on), 
            is standing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The green tornado on the ground.
          <ul>
            <li>You get thrown from the center of the tornado.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
