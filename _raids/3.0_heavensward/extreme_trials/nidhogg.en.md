# The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage

## Markers

`A` and `B` are used to dodge alternate Sable Prices, starting with the first.

A more modern approach would be to use `ABCD` to mark cardinal directions, and use `1` and `2` for Sable Price instead (there were only `ABC` markers available at the time).
