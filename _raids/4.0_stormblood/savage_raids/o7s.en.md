# Sigmascape V3.0 (Savage)

Because the Bibliotaph can spawn with the first *Run Program*, the MT will
start the fight pulling the boss slightly **North-East** of the center.

## Markers

- `A` and `B` just marks North and South, while the `1` marker is the center.
- The `C` marker is where Virus is passed.
