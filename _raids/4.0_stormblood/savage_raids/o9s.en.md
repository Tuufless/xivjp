## Markers

- The `ABCD` markers mark the cardinal positions, and where the players with
  *Dynamic Fluid* should stand to hit their partners with the donut AoE during
  the Dark Crystal phase.
- The `1` and `2` markers are where the party should stack for the donut AoEs
  during the Tsunami phase when the boss is casting *Damning Edict*.
